# Polling App With Realtime Response(Sockets)

Just a quick little project I made while practicing Django and backend development.  
This is part of my journey as I learn and improve my skills.

This is a real-time polling application built with Django and Django Channels. It allows users to vote on a poll, and the results are updated instantly across all connected clients using WebSockets.

## Features
- Live vote count updates without page reloads
- WebSocket integration using Django Channels
- Responsive and interactive front-end
- Built with real-time performance in mind

## Technologies Used
- Django
- Django Channels
- WebSockets
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Learning Goals
- Understand and implement asynchronous communication in Django
- Integrate WebSockets for real-time data streaming
- Build dynamic, real-time web applications

## About the Project

This project is built using Django and includes basic frontend styling with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript.  
I usually focus on the backend side of things and try to keep things simple and clean.  
Each project I make is a way for me to learn something new or reinforce what I already know.


## Technologies Used

- Python
- Django
